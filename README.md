# Clustering of unknown sounds
## Description
This repository gathers python and R scripts used to generate the output of the publication Calonge et al. (2024) Revised clusters of annotated unknown sounds in the Belgian part of the North Sea. 

## Installation
Necessary python packages can be installed using conda with the environment.yml file, or with pip using requirements.txt.

This can be re-used for any Raven selection table, and parameters to be used can be defined in a config file following the same structure than the example config.json
